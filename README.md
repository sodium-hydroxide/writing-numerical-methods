Numerical techniques are abundant in modern scientific disciplines and are commonly used to solve equations which would be difficult or impossible to solve in closed form or estimate measurements that a research is unable to currently perform. These can include simple methods, such as numerically solving differential and integral equations, to more complex methods such as Monte Carlo for transport theory, or simulations for computational fluid dynamics. When writing about these techniques for a thesis, dissertation, or article, it is prudent to describe several concepts regarding the numerical technique for readers to understand what utility is provided by the technique and why numerical methods were chosen over mathematical calculations or experiments. This report will provide an overview of how to write about numerical techniques and provide an outline for their use.
